## Problem.
Develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying sign language alphabet images into their respective categories. The aim of this project is to train a model that can generalize effectively on new data and achieve high accuracy rates on the test set.

## Objective.
The objective of this project is to train a deep learning model that can accurately classify sign language alphabet images into their respective classes. The model should be able to generalize well on unseen data and achieve a high accuracy on the test set.

## Abstract.
Our project aims to utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the purpose of interpreting American Sign Language (ASL) signs based on a series of images. We aspire to enhance accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing by introducing this CNN technology as an alternative means of interacting with their smart devices and applications. One potential application of this technology is during video chats, where the CNN model could enable a feature that converts sign language to speech. As the user signs, the computer would translate the gestures into audible speech.
