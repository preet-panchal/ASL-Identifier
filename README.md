## Abstract.
The dataset is a combined heart disease dataset consisting of 11 features and 918 observations. The aim of the dataset is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using these features. The features in the dataset include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. The dataset was created by combining five different heart disease datasets, making it the largest heart disease dataset available for research purposes.

## Problem.
For our project, we are studying a binary classification problem, where we try to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the 11 input features. The problem can be framed as training a machine learning model to accurately classify patients into two categories: those with heart disease (output class = 1) and those without heart disease (output class = 0). 

## Objective.
The aim of the project would be to develop a machine learning model that can generalize well on unseen data and achieve a high accuracy rate on the test set.
